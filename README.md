Driver library for 128x64 OLED screens with SSD1306 driver (I2C)
================================================================

Library for the Arduino IDE. Works with Arduino or ESP8266 modules.


Features
--------

* **Draw String with a provided font**
* **Draw a provided Image (bitmap)**
* **Draw a horizontal/vertical line**
* **Draw a progress bar**


Install the library
-------------------

We need to copy the *OLED128x64* folder into your Arduino Library location.
By default, here are the default locations:

* **Mac:** *In (home)/Documents/Arduino/libraries*
* **Windows:** *My Documents -> Arduino -> libraries*
* **Linux:** *(home)/sketchbook/libraries*

Once the *OLED128x64* folder is in there, you may start (or restart) your
Arduino IDE.
